Was messed around with quickdev command cheat. I found other items ID lists are dead or outdated so just do it myself, Updated 5/2/2025, 1.0 Update contained.
Don't know if anyone need it or not, I just do it. Look like no animal, or carryable item yet, I messed with item in inventory function only.
